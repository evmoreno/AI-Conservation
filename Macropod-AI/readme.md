<H1> Brush Tailed Rockwallaby Experinment </H1>

Hardware acquired for this solution included:

1) Azure Percept + 8020 building system https://8020.net/ being fixed to side of the cottage, next to satelite areal which has an expansive view paddocks, dam and a transition between two paddocks. I will be capturing images of Eastern Grey Kangaroos, Wallabies, Wallaroos, Wombats and echidna.

2) PR-100 Waterproof Trap Night Vision Camera -  Exploring placement on fence posts in back paddock where the wallabies stop to graze on sunset.

3) Drones (TBD)

Using guidance here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/iot-edge-vision/camera to understand considerations for IoT Edge Vision camera placement.



<H2> Raw Data </H2> 
All videos, images will be uploaded to the image folder this repo for access whomever would like to explore.


<H2> Image Labeling </H2>
Azure Percept integrates into CustomVision.AI which simplifies creation of classification, this referred to as a low code option - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-percept/tutorial-nocode-vision

<H2> Azure ML Image Labelling </H2>
Once I have raw data, my intention to use Azure ML to automate image labeling - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-labeling#
